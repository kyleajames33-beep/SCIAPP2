      "explanation": "A physical change alters the form or appearance of a substance but does not change its chemical composition (e.g., melting ice, tearing paper). These changes are typically reversible. A chemical change, however, results in the formation of new substances with different chemical properties (e.g., burning wood, rusting iron). Chemical changes are generally irreversible through simple physical means.",

      "explanation": "Chemical properties describe a substance's ability to undergo chemical changes and form new substances. Reacting with oxygen to form rust (iron oxide) is a chemical property because it describes iron's ability to participate in a chemical reaction. Magnetic attraction, electrical conductivity, and melting point are all physical properties as they can be observed without changing the chemical identity of the substance.",

      "explanation": "The best approach is a multi-step process: First, use magnetic separation to remove the iron filings (iron is magnetic, sand and salt are not). Then, add water to dissolve the salt (salt is soluble, sand is not). Filter to separate the insoluble sand from the salt solution. Finally, evaporate the water to recover the salt crystals. This sequential approach exploits the different physical properties of each component.",

      "options": ["The reaction violates the law of conservation of mass", "The additional mass comes from oxygen combining with magnesium", "The magnesium absorbed energy from the surroundings, increasing its mass", "The scale was not calibrated correctly"],

      "worldId": 1,
      "chamberId": "properties-of-matter",
      "explanation": "According to the Law of Conservation of Mass, mass is neither created nor destroyed in chemical reactions. The increase in mass from 5.0 g to 8.3 g (an increase of 3.3 g) is explained by the magnesium combining with oxygen from the air to form magnesium oxide (MgO). The balanced equation is: 2Mg + O₂ → 2MgO. The additional 3.3 g represents the mass of oxygen that bonded with the magnesium. This demonstrates that in chemical reactions, the total mass of reactants equals the total mass of products.",

      "explanation": "Isotopes are atoms of the same element (same atomic number/proton count) that have different numbers of neutrons, resulting in different mass numbers. For example, Carbon-12 has 6 protons and 6 neutrons, while Carbon-14 has 6 protons and 8 neutrons. Since they have the same number of protons, they exhibit identical chemical properties but differ in physical properties such as radioactivity (for unstable isotopes).",

      "chamberId": "atomic-structure-and-periodicity",
      "explanation": "Atomic number = number of protons = 17. In a neutral atom, electrons = protons = 17. Neutrons = mass number - atomic number = 35 - 17 = 18. This is an atom of chlorine (Cl).

      "worldId": 1,
      "chamberId": "atomic-structure-and-periodicity",
      "explanation": "Atomic radius decreases from left to right across a period because the effective nuclear charge increases. As protons are added to the nucleus, the increased positive charge pulls the electron cloud closer to the nucleus, despite electrons being added to the same principal energy level. This trend is opposite to what happens when moving down a group, where atomic radius increases due to additional electron shells.",

      "explanation": "A covalent bond is formed when two atoms share one or more pairs of valence electrons.

Metallic lattices conduct as solids, covalent molecular substances have low melting points, and covalent network substances like diamond do not conduct electricity at all.",

      "worldId": 1,
      "chamberId": "atomic-structure-and-periodicity",
      "explanation": "Electronegativity generally increases across a period from left to right as the number of protons in the nucleus increases, strengthening the attraction for bonding electrons. At the same time, the atoms become smaller, so the nucleus is closer to the valence electrons, which further increases the effective nuclear attraction.",

      "difficulty": "Foundation",
      "worldId": 1,
      "chamberId": "bonding",
      "explanation": "Metallic bonding occurs in metals, where metal atoms release some of their valence electrons to form a lattice of positive metal cations surrounded by a sea of delocalised electrons. The electrostatic attraction between these cations and the delocalised electrons holds the metal lattice together and explains properties such as conductivity and malleability.",

      "explanation": "Hydrogen bonding occurs when hydrogen is covalently bonded to a highly electronegative atom such as oxygen, nitrogen or fluorine, creating a strong dipole. In water, O–H bonds are highly polar, so the partially positive hydrogen atoms are strongly attracted to lone pairs on oxygen atoms of neighbouring molecules, producing hydrogen bonds.",

      "explanation": "London dispersion forces are weak intermolecular forces that arise from temporary, instantaneous dipoles caused by random movement of electrons in atoms and molecules.
